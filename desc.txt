PROJECT NAME: TRU

Tagline: The Decentralized Trust Protocol. Domain: Cybersecurity / Blockchain / AI
Executive Summary

TRU is an autonomous cognitive security ecosystem designed to combat the weaponization of misinformation. Unlike traditional fact-checking, which is slow and centralized, TRU acts as a real-time "Credit Rating System" for information. We leverage Autonomous AI Agents to analyze viral content and Blockchain Technology to create an immutable, censorship-resistant record of truth.
The Problem (Why We Built This)

Misinformation is no longer just a social nuisance; it is a critical cybersecurity threat.

    Financial Fraud: Phishing links (e.g., "Free ₹1000 Scheme") steal millions daily because they appear legitimate and bypass standard filters.

    State-Level Panic: Rumors (e.g., "Ceasefire Broken," "Dam Collapsed") spread faster than authorities can debunk them, causing real-world riots and economic instability.

    The "Memory Hole": When a lie is debunked, the correction often disappears, but the lie remains. There is no permanent, unhackable "Red Flag" attached to malicious content.

The Solution: A Dual-Layer Ecosystem

TRU is not just a tool; it is a self-sustaining ecosystem composed of two core autonomous entities:
1. The Brain (AI-Y)

An autonomous Python-based intelligence that acts as the "Judge."

    Ingestion: It constantly scrapes high-velocity social media feeds and suspicious URLs.

    Logic: It uses a weighted algorithm (Source Credibility + Sentiment Analysis + Cross-Reference) to calculate a mathematical Trust Score (0-100).

    Example: A panic-inducing tweet from an unverified domain might receive a Score of 12/100 (CRITICAL RISK).

2. The Face (Project X Platform)

The public-facing dashboard and alert system.

    Visualization: It automatically converts the AI's raw data into simple "Red Alert" or "Green Verified" cards for the public.

    The Blockchain Seal: Simultaneously, it writes the verdict to the Polygon Blockchain. This creates a permanent audit trail (Transaction Hash) proving that this specific link was marked as a SCAM at this specific time.

Key Features
Immutable Truth Records

We don't just store data in a database; we mint it on-chain. If TRU marks a URL as a "Scam," that record exists forever on the Polygon network. No hacker, government, or bad actor can delete the history of that lie.
Gamified Vigilance ($TRUTH Tokens)

We turn every user into a cybersecurity agent.

    The Bounty System: If a user forwards a suspicious link to our WhatsApp Bot that turns out to be a NEW scam (one the AI hasn't seen before), the Smart Contract automatically rewards them with $TRUTH Tokens.

    Result: A crowdsourced, decentralized defense network that scales instantly.

Zero-Touch Autonomy

The entire pipeline—from scanning a tweet to analyzing it, scoring it, minting the blockchain record, and posting the alert—happens automatically. No human intervention is required.
The Tech Stack (Zero-Cost Architecture)

    Intelligence: Python, Google Gemini (Free Tier), Scikit-learn (Sentiment Analysis).

    Blockchain: Polygon Amoy Testnet (Smart Contracts), Web3.py.

    Frontend: Next.js (React 19), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.

    Integration: Twilio API (WhatsApp Bot).

Real-World Impact

Firewalls protect your servers. TRU protects your reality. By combining the speed of AI with the trust of Blockchain, we are building the immune system for the information age.
